## Benefits of using views:
Views in ASP.NET Core MVC provide a way to separate the presentation layer from the application's logic, enhancing maintainability and reusability. They enable the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces by rendering data from the controllers.

## Creating a view:
Views are typically represented as Razor files (.cshtml) in ASP.NET Core MVC. Developers can create views by adding these files to the "Views" folder of their project. Views define the structure and layout of the user interface.

## How controllers specify views:
Controllers in MVC specify which view to render by returning an instance of the ViewResult class, passing the view name as a parameter. This decoupling allows controllers to focus on data processing while views handle the presentation.

## Pass data to views:
Controllers can send data to views by populating the ViewData dictionary or by using strongly-typed models through the View method. This data can then be accessed and displayed in the view's HTML.
## 4 Ways To Create Form In ASP.NET MVC


- Forms - Weakly Typed (Synchronous):
This method involves creating forms with simple inputs and is suitable for basic scenarios. Developers manually retrieve form data from request parameters in the controller. It's easy to set up but lacks strong typing and can lead to errors.

- Forms - Strongly Typed (Synchronous):
Using this method, developers pass model objects to the view, which binds form fields to the model's properties. The Razor syntax and HTML helpers provide strong typing and IntelliSense support. Controller actions receive the strongly typed model directly as a parameter, making form handling more intuitive.

- Forms - Strongly Typed AJAX (Asynchronous):
This approach leverages AJAX to submit form data asynchronously without reloading the entire page. JQuery Unobtrusive AJAX simplifies AJAX form creation. The form updates specific page elements, enhancing user experience, and avoids full page reloads. It's well-suited for dynamic content updates.

- Pure HTML Forms with AJAX and jQuery:
This method involves constructing the form with pure HTML and utilizing jQuery to submit data to the controller asynchronously. JavaScript code gathers form data, sends it to the controller using AJAX, and handles the response. It provides more control over data manipulation and interaction.
