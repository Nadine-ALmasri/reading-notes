## Q: What is a Binary Tree?
A: A Binary Tree is a tree data structure in which each node can have at most two children, commonly referred to as the "left" child and the "right" child. It is a hierarchical structure where nodes are connected by edges, and the topmost node is called the "Root." Each node in a Binary Tree can have at most one parent, except for the root node, which has no parent.

## Q: What is the purpose of a Root node in a tree?
A: The Root node serves as the starting point of a tree data structure. It is the topmost node and has no parent. All other nodes in the tree are descendants of the Root, and it provides the entry point to access the entire tree.

## Q: What is the difference between Depth First and Breadth First tree traversals?
A: Depth First traversal prioritizes exploring the depth (height) of the tree first, visiting nodes along a single branch before backtracking. In contrast, Breadth First traversal explores nodes level by level, starting from the Root and moving to the next level of children before going deeper.

## Q: What is the height of a tree?
A: The height of a tree is the maximum number of edges from the Root to the furthest leaf node. It represents the longest path from the Root to any leaf in the tree.

## Q: What is the significance of a Leaf node in a tree?
A: A Leaf node, also known as an external node, is a node that does not have any children. It represents the endpoints of a branch in a tree and signifies the termination of a path.

## Q: How does recursion help in tree traversal algorithms?
A: Recursion is a powerful technique used in tree traversals. When applying recursive algorithms, a function calls itself to explore subtrees and navigate through the tree structure efficiently. It allows for a concise and elegant way to handle complex tree traversal operations.

## Q: What does the "K" value represent in a K-ary Tree?
A: In a K-ary Tree, the "K" value represents the maximum number of children any node can have. For example, in a Binary Tree, K is equal to 2, meaning each node can have at most two children (left and right). In a K-ary Tree, K can be any positive integer, defining the branching factor of the tree.
