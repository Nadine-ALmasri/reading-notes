## Create a Web app with authentication:
 the process of setting up a web application in ASP.NET Core with authentication features. Authentication is crucial for controlling access to certain parts of the application and ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions.

## Scaffold Register, Login, LogOut, and RegisterConfirmation:
"Scaffolding" refers to the process of automatically generating code and files to handle common tasks in ASP.NET Core Identity. In this section, i explore how to scaffold the necessary code for user registration, login, logout, and registration confirmation. Scaffolding saves time by generating boilerplate code, which can be customized as needed.

## Test Identity:
Testing is a crucial aspect of any software development process. In this section, thier are various aspects of testing the ASP.NET Core Identity features. This may include writing unit tests to ensure that the authentication and user management functionalities work as expected and remain reliable.

## Identity Components:
Identity components refer to the individual building blocks or elements that constitute the ASP.NET Core Identity system. This section likely discusses the various components such as User, Role, Claims, and other related elements that make up the identity management infrastructure.

## Migrating to ASP.NET Core Identity:
Migrating to ASP.NET Core Identity involves transitioning an existing web application from a different authentication system to the ASP.NET Core Identity system. This section provides guidance on how to handle the migration process, including data migration and code changes, to seamlessly integrate Identity into an existing project.

## Setting password strength:
Password strength is an essential aspect of security when dealing with user accounts.and how to configure password strength policies, such as enforcing minimum password length, requiring special characters, uppercase letters, or numbers. Implementing strong password policies helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.

## AddDefaultIdentity and AddIdentity:
In ASP.NET Core, there are two main approaches to set up Identity: using AddDefaultIdentity and AddIdentity. 
### AddDefaultIdentity:
 AddDefaultIdentity is a high-level method that configures the most common features of the Identity system with sensible defaults.
It sets up a basic identity system that includes user registration, login, logout, and password reset functionalities.
By using AddDefaultIdentity, the application automatically gets a pre-configured user and role model along with their corresponding storage.
This method is suitable for simple scenarios where you want to quickly add basic authentication functionality to your application without much customization.
It provides a streamlined approach, reducing the amount of code needed to set up the Identity system, making it beginner-friendly and ideal for prototyping or small projects.
However, its simplicity comes with limitations as it may not cover all use cases and may not offer the level of customization required for more complex applications.
### AddIdentity:
AddIdentity is a more flexible and customizable method to configure the Identity system.
Unlike AddDefaultIdentity, it allows you to specify custom user and role models or use an existing database schema for identity data storage.
It also provides more fine-grained control over various aspects of the Identity system, such as password policies, lockout settings, and cookie options.
Using AddIdentity, you have the freedom to extend or modify the default behavior of the Identity system to meet the specific requirements of your application.
This method is suitable for larger and more complex applications where you need to tailor the authentication and identity management to align with unique business rules and workflows.
However, with increased flexibility comes additional complexity. Configuring AddIdentity may require writing more code and handling some of the aspects that AddDefaultIdentity sets up automatically.
### When to use each approach:

 - Use AddDefaultIdentity when you have a small to medium-sized project with standard authentication requirements and prefer a quick and straightforward setup.
- Use AddIdentity when you have more advanced requirements, such as using custom user or role models, integrating with an existing database schema, or implementing complex password policies and lockout mechanisms.

## Prevent publish of static Identity assets:
ASP.NET Core Identity includes static assets, such as CSS, JavaScript, and image files, required for its user interface. we learn  how to prevent these static assets from being published or deployed to the production server, which can help reduce unnecessary files and improve the application's overall security.

## Run a Full Signum Node on Windows or Linux



### Certainly! Setting up a Signum full node on both Windows and Linux platforms involves the following steps:

- For Windows:

Download the Signum software: Visit the Signum website and download the latest zip release of the Signum software for Windows.

Unzip the downloaded file: After downloading, unzip the contents to any location on your PC.

Run the Signum node: To start the Signum node, double-click the "signum-node.exe" file. If you don't have Java installed, you'll be prompted to download and install it, or you can use a portable Java installation.

Create a batch file (optional, for portable Java): If you prefer not to install Java globally, download "jPortable" and create a new folder called "Java" in the Signum folder. Set the destination folder during installation to the newly created "Java" folder. Then, create a batch file named "signum.bat" with the command to start the Signum node using the portable Java installation.

- For Linux:

Download the Signum software: Download the same Signum software as you did for Windows, as it is compatible with both platforms.

Navigate to the Signum folder: Create a new folder in your home directory called "Signum" and navigate to it using the terminal or console.

Run the Signum node with Java: Use the command "java -jar signum-node.jar" in the terminal to launch the Signum node directly. Alternatively, you can make the "burst.jar" file executable with "chmod +x signum-node.jar" and double-click it in the file explorer.

OR

Set up Signum node with Docker (recommended for consistency): Install Docker and docker-compose on your Linux system. Create a new file named "docker-compose.yml" in the "Signum" folder and paste the provided configuration into it. Use the command "docker-compose up -d" to launch the Signum Node software.

## Using Wyam on GitLab Pages with Continuous Integration

- Wyam is not natively supported on many platforms due to not running on Linux at the time of the article's publication.
- Two possibilities are offered for CI with Wyam: wait for .NET Core support or follow the tutorial provided in the article.
- Act I: Requires a GitLab.com account, knowledge of GitLab runners, and the creation of a GitLab Pages repository.
- Act II: Involves setting up GitLab Runner on a Windows machine, registering it as a specific runner for the repository, and configuring a .gitlab-ci.yml file.
- The .gitlab-ci.yml file defines two stages (build and deploy) and contains PowerShell commands to generate the Wyam site and deploy it to GitLab Pages.
- Act III: After pushing the master branch to the GitLab repo, the pipeline triggers the CI process, compiling the site and updating GitLab Pages.
