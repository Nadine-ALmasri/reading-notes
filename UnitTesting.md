# Unit Testing and Documentation
- **why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module.**
   - its important since its provide the user with the informations needed to deal with project so he can understand and work with it .
   - it helps with navigate, modify, and debug the codebase .
- **Name 3 ways in which Unit Testing improves your codebase and productivity.**    
     -  Test code frequently in less time .
     - catch the bugs before deployment .
     - refactor our code with confedance .              


- **How would you write a unit test for a household task such as putting away laundry?**    
   - We need to create specific scenarios and then write Write test cases to check these scenarios , for example :
        - We need to check if all the clothes are clean 
        - and then check if all clothes are seperated depnding on their type 
        - and the check if every type of them is sorted and been putted at the correct place .
  - then we need to implement the test steps:
     - Test case 1 : is all the clothes clean ?
     - Test case 2 : are they sorted depnding on type ?
     - Test case 3 : are they putted in the right place ?

- **Name 3 reasons a quality README is just as important as quality code.**
   - Giving informations and details about the project.
   - Giving overview of the project and how it works for a new team member joined later so it helps with communication.
   - making it easier to understand the project's purpose, functionalities, and any specific requirements or constraints.
   - helps with the future development .

- **When writing a README for your co-developers, name 4 crucial elements to include.**
  -  Provide informations about the project , the purpose, goals,and workflow .
  - Give instructions in how to get the project locally and how to start it and run it 
  - Talk about the usage of the project 
  - include all the documentation needed such as the API .
